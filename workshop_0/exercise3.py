# Congrats! you've made it to the last exercise 

# Exercise 3
# Complete the functions below
# use the command: py -m pytest -l 
# to test your code in the terminal

# 1. write a function called getAverage that takes a parameter grades which
# is an array of test scores from a scale of 0.0 - 100.0
# the function should return the average of these numbers


# 2. write a function called fizzBuzz that takes the parameter number and returns an array
# loops from the range 1 (inclusive) to number (exclusive)
# if the number is divisible by 3, append 'Fizz' to the array
# if the number is divisible by 5, append 'Buzz' to the array
# if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, append 'FizzBuzz' to the array
# else just append the number as itself 


# 3. create a function called hasDuplicates which 
# takes in the parameter numbers and returns true if 
# the array of numbers has a duplicate value and false otherwise


# 4. (optional) write a function called reverseText 
# that takes in the parameter text and returns 
# the reversed version of it
# hint: search for slice indexing in google
